# Hello and thank you for stopping by!

My name is Jim Liriano. I am a once public servant now happily converted software developer with an immense passion for coding!

I consider myself a software developer with comfort both on the front end through React...and the back end with Node!

I love to learn and I am always open to diving into something new in this field.

- :page_with_curl: I’m interested in finding work in any role as long as I am given an opportunity to learn!
- :bulb: I know HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node and further expanding my skills every day!
- :brain: I’m currently learning Redux with a mix of self learning and professional instruction!
- :atom: I am currently working on an interactive version of my resume with React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing Discord bots if anyone is seeking an eager learner!
